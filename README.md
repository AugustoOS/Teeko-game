Teeko is a two-player abstract strategy game invented by John Scarne in 1945. The game is played on a 5x5 grid, and the objective is to align four of your markers in a straight line, square, or diamond shape. Here's a detailed breakdown of the rules:

Setup:
Board: A 5x5 grid (total of 25 spaces).
Markers: Each player has four markers of a unique color (e.g., red for Player 1 and black for Player 2).
Phases:
Teeko consists of two phases: the placement phase and the movement phase.

1. Placement Phase:
Players take turns placing one of their markers on any unoccupied space on the grid.
The placement phase continues until all eight markers (four for each player) have been placed on the board.
2. Movement Phase:
After all markers have been placed, players take turns moving one of their markers to an adjacent empty space (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
Players are not allowed to jump over or move into a space occupied by another marker.
Winning the Game:
A player wins by aligning four of their markers in any of the following configurations:

Straight Line: Four markers in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
Square: Four markers forming a 2x2 square.
Diamond: Four markers arranged in a diamond shape (i.e., two in the center row, one above and one below).
Draw:
If neither player can achieve a winning configuration, and no further moves can be made that change the outcome, the game ends in a draw.
Teeko is a simple yet strategic game that requires careful planning and foresight to outmaneuver your opponent.
